# Dreadful Cherry Tomatoes

Dreadful Cherry Tomatoes is a new platform to find movies. The main objective is to
help users to find information about their favourite movies.

To do so, the company has to create a new web app that allow users to do some fancy things.

## What do you have to do?

Dreadful Cherry Tomatoes needs to implement an awesome webpage where the users could view information
about almost every new movie.

The Design team has sent us the new interface which has to be implemented. To keep it simple, there is only one page: the movies page.

The movies page is the landing page of the webpage and shows a list of movies. In this page the user will see a list of cards with the title, year, description and image from each movie, sorted by the most recent. 10 cards per page, sorted by most recent release year. And the user could filter movies by title.

Here you could see the design of the movies pages:
